# Personal Information

## About me

I am a Computer Science and Data Science (emphasis on Linguistics) double major student at UC Berkeley. I am interested in Machine Learning, CS Education, and Game Development.

I am a 5-th time Teaching Assistant for CS 61B: Data Structures course for UC Berkeley - a 1500-student course, having created discussion worksheets, held sections and office hours, and offered one-on-one debugging help to students.

## Projects and Experiences

### The serious ones

1. I was a Machine Learning Intern at ReachBest, a startup supported by the Berkeley startup accelerator SkyDeck. I developed an essay review assistant using machine learning.
2. I worked on a few projects in the Data Science Discovery Team "Ancient World Computational Analysis" with Prof. Adam Anderson:
    - I tried to fine-tune LLaMa Langugage Model on Cuneiform Languages.
    - I created a Bidirectional LSTM to perform named entity recognition (NER) on citation entries.
3. I worked as an open-source software and data engineer with the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program.

### The not-so-serious ones
1. I created a Unity game that simulates the journey of a sperm, with multiplayer. [Play here](https://circlecly.itch.io/spermulator)
2. I created another Unity game about ship wars. [Play here](https://circlecly.itch.io/ship-wars)
3. I created Minecraft and Terraria crossover mods that brings in contents from Chaos Rings III, a niche and old Japanese RPG game. I also created a Terraria mod that adapts sound effects from a Chinese card game called "War of Three Kingdoms (三国杀)".
4. I created a small Witcher 3 crossover mod for the game Binding of Isaac.
5. I created two Undertale simulators: a Sans Fight Simulator, as well as a Colored Tiles Puzzle Simulator.
6. I hacked with game assets: I once made a Terraria background music pack that brings in a mixture of other games (Galaxy On Fire 2, Chaos Rings III, etc.). I also hacked images for Plants VS Zombies to make it "Math VS Zombies".
